But it was mainly written in pure VimL, making it inherently much slower when searching/filtering at scale(see [\#140](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/issues/140)). I have spent a lot of effort to tackle the performance issue of vim-clap. And now I'm very happy to share some good news! With the latest version of vim-clap, the performance issue and the flicker of running async job(I wrongly thought this flicker is hard to fix before) have been completely resoloved! All the heavy job has been handled by the external binary written in Rust. And vim-clap now can deal with even 1 million items decently.

[https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap)

To have a performant and nicer vim-clap, ensure you have Rust installed on your system and then run `:call clap#helper#build_all()` for building all the optional external depdencies.

By selecting the two lines of code by `Vj` and typing `:!python &lt;CR&gt;`, the selected lines would get executed and replaced by:

is there a generic way to close floating windows, or something specific for coc?

2) operations around functions with af and if (like cif) dont work for some reason. 

:echo CocHasProvider('documentSymbol') shows v:true. i used the mappings from [Readme.md](https://Readme.md) (omap/xmap if &lt;Plug&gt;(coc-funcobj-i)).

anyone else experiencing this? anything else is needed to make this work?

3) Rename symbol works, but after i rename something and dont do :wa, i get lots of errors of unknown name, might be because ccls reads the other files without their changes, meaning it reads them with the old name, and therefore doesnt recognize the new name in the current file.

Function is shown below is unused despite its counterpart ""s:NetrwSaveWordPost()"" being used, it basically remembers the directory/file that was under your cursor:

listing, sorting, etc unusable. The only down side I can see in using this, is the conundrum of having two files with 

identical filenames in the same directory in tree-listing. However, I think this is resolved by the incorporation of '|' in

demeaning directory depth to the user. In conclusion, why is it unused? What would be the best way to implement back

```
cnoremap &lt;expr&gt; &lt;space&gt; '/?' =~ getcmdtype() ? "".*"" : ""&lt;space&gt;""
```

This makes it so everytime you press `&lt;space&gt;`, but only in the `/` or `?` searching command lines, you insert a `.*` instead. So now typing `/def foo` can find `def foo` or `def bar(foo)`.

Another kind of interesting one is:

```
cnoremap &lt;expr&gt; &lt;space&gt; '/?' =~ getcmdtype() ? "".*\\_s*.*"" : ""&lt;space&gt;""
```

This matches any character, followed by one newline, followed by any character (roughly something like that, I'm not a regex expert). You can use this for some crazy visual selections across lines without much thinking about the regex involved. If for some reason you had like:





    def bar
      foo
    end





You can then type `/def&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;end` to match the whole thing. Obviously this is a contrived example but I thought it was interesting.

If you want to retain normal usage of `/` but have this option available, you could also make it happen only on `?`:

```
cnoremap &lt;expr&gt; &lt;space&gt; getcmdtype() == ""?"" ? "".*"" : ""&lt;space&gt;""
```

Then to fuzzy search you'd just have to hit `?` remember to swap your `n`s and `N`s. I personally never press `?` and just use `n` and `N` respectively inside of an `/` search anyways.

This might seem like sacrilege to the regex aficionados but I was exposed to the fuzzy searching of sublime before I ever got into vim, so this simple little change is like a life changer for me.

Note credit for some of the vimscript here goes to romainl, as always his vim fu is insane and I found this specific kind of way to cmap only for ? and / and then used it for the purposes of fuzzy searching.",Dead simple fuzzy searching with /,0

This is pretty convenient as it is a lot quicker than pressing zo with less movement of the fingers. But the same does not work on simpylfold. Looking through both help files it does not seem to be mentioned in either file.

My question is now, how can I emulate the behaviour of vimtex for simpylfold (or any file with foldings in general).

Lots of you will know about LSP (Language Server Protocol), of which there are many Vim clients of various quality (obviously, YCM is the best! :D), but there's also DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) which is to debuggers what LSP is to completion engines.

Vimspector implements the DAP client and a debugging front-end for Vim. It supports a number of languages out of the box and in theory _any language that VSCode supports_ debugging.

* Not super easy to configure, but mostly that's because of the protocol/servers

I also get ""E303: Unable to open swap file for ""..."", recovery not possible"" on every file I attempt to open if that's helpful.

There are a lot of vi binding and vim emulators out there. I've made a hash of one, contributed to another, and now I'm writing a third. Ideally, I'd like to use a similar algorithm so that it's as easy as possible to match vim's behavior.

It has built-in functionality for 1) changing windows, 2) resizing windows and 3) swapping buffers, and is extensible so that more functionality can be added by users.

The plugin uses popup and floating windows from `vim&gt;=8.2` and `nvim&gt;=0.4.0`. Limited functionality is available with `vim&gt;=vim&gt;=8.1.1140`, but the interface is deficient.

Feedback is welcome!

Now vim has one weakness: It is super configurable. Yeah, I now people love that feature but honestly I just can't be arsed to spent hours upon tweaking the config. It is especially bad, as I use a extreme variety of programming languages and having to research the best plugins for every one would leave me with no time for actually writing code. (Not trying to offend people that like tweaking their editors, this just ain't for me.)

Just taking taking someones elses config does not really work that well either because they have build it mostly for their special use cases.

I wanted my buffers to behave exactly like tabs in Chrome or Firefox when they are closed and I also wanted to prevent the destruction of windows on buffer deletion so I came up with this mapping:
    "" Close buffer (without closing window)
    nnoremap &lt;expr&gt;&lt;leader&gt;w len(getbufinfo("""")[0].windows) &gt; 1 ?
        \ "":close&lt;CR&gt;"" :
        \ (bufnr("""") == getbufinfo({""buflisted"": 1})[-1].bufnr ? "":bp"" : "":bn"").""&lt;bar&gt;bd #&lt;CR&gt;""

It first checks if the buffer we want to close is present in more than one window. If so, only the window is closed (just a personal preference, you can remove that check if it's not the behavior you expect). Otherwise it checks if the current buffer is the last one (ie has the highest buffer number). Based on the result, we switch either to the next or the previous buffer exactly like tabs in Chrome/Firefox. Then the buffer we just left is closed. This is done in this order to prevent the closing of any window.

I also display my open buffers using vim-airline's option:
    let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1

Here are the stuff I kept forgetting about.

```d``` is the delete operator.

Motion

```w``` &gt; excluding its first character.

```e``` &gt; Including the last character

pressing ```e``` at first goes to the end of the first word then jumps to the end of the next words.

pressing ```b``` will start jumping at the beginning of next word forward.

```d number motion```

You insert count before motion.

```2dd`` deletes two lines.

```u``` to undo last command, ```U``` to fix a whole line and ```CTRL + r``` for redo.

To put with ```p``` place cursor above or before.

```rx``` replace the underline character with 'x'.

```ce``` deletes character at cursor to the end of the line and puts in ```insert mode```

```c``` is delete and insert.

```CTRL + G``` to show your location in the file and file status and information. 

```gg``` to the top of the file, ```G``` to the bottom of the file.

Type in line number than either press ```G``` or ```gg```.

```/``` for forward search, ```?``` for reverse search. ```n``` to find the next searched item forward. ```N``` goes backward.

```CTRL + o``` puts where you had your cursor before, ```CTRL + i``` goes forward.

```%``` to go the ending bracket if you are at the beginning bracket.

```:s/new/old/g``` for replace operation within the **line**. Without ```g``` only changes first occurance. ```:%s``` replaces throughout the file. You can also do it with ranges of line ```:beginning line number,ending line number```then ```s```.

Running a shell command from vim ```:!ls``` so, ```:!``` then command.

Writing files with name ```:w test```

Using visual selection to write blocks of code to a seperate file. First select with ```v``` then, ```:``` to see the lines selected, then ```w test```.

Merging files ```:r test``` retrieve the file ```test``` and put in the cursor.

You can also input external command line output this way ```:r !ls```.

```o``` opens a line a below puts you on insert mode. ```O``` opens a line above.

For multicharacter replace use ```R```. While in replace mode, as you write the underlying characters will be replaced.

For searching with ignore case ```:set ic```. To enable highlighting of found words ```:set hls is```

Prepand 'no' to switch an option off ```:set noic```

```ctrl + w``` to jump windows.

```:help user-manual```

Vimrc ```:help vimrc-intro```

```CTRL + d``` shows the suggestions, ```tab``` does autocomplete.",It took me an hour and ten minutes to go through vim tutor completely. Saying that it would take 20 minutes to go through it is a lie.,0

Here is the command:
`:v/\/foo\./d | :%s/.*\(https.*\)\(\.gif\|\.webm\).*/\1\2/`

The first command deletes every line without the string `foo.` The second command uses substitution on the remaining lines to remove anything that comes before and after the hyperlink. The problem is, running the command like this is SLOW. The first time doing anything in Vim was ever slow for me actually. The process uses more CPU than usual and the output spits out `828738 substitutions on 828738 lines`. Wait, what?

So what's going on here?

I ran the commands separately and they worked without any slowdown as you'd expect. I did some searching but haven't found an answer on why this happens. Though I did find an alternative. Pressing `Ctrl+v` then `Ctrl+j` results in the characters `^@` appearing in a blue color different from the default styling. This is called null character, I'm just learning this myself. Anyway, I replaced the bar with the character and bingo, it ran both commands quickly free of issue.

Is there any reason why I wouldn't want to use `^@` instead of the bar when entering multiple commands?

I have an elementary vim scripting question. I'd like to write a Vim command that does the following:

1. Make a new split.
2. Launch a terminal program.
3. Wait for the program to stop and close the split.
4. Read the output produced in the second step into the original buffer.

This seems like a very common work flow, but I'm having trouble getting it to work. The problem is in steps 3 and 4. As a test I defined:

    function MyExitFunction(a,b,c)   
      close   
      read blah 
    endfunction 

Then did:

    :new | call termopen('fzf&gt;blah',{on_exit:MyExitFunction}

 command, however, seems to do nothing. What should I do to get the  program output into the original buffer?

Matlab has a ""peculiarity"" where if you want to instantiate the class ""foo"" which is located at `./+package1/+package2/@foo/foo.m` OR `./+package1/+package2/foo.m` you would say `myFoo = package1.package2.foo();` which is annoying because it's hard to complete outside of Matlab's built in editor.  I got some help early on in making a function to add to `gf` so I can open files structured like this, but tools like coc.nvim can't really help with completion unless you actually know the path structure before hand.

FZF is helpful for completion in general, so I thought why not use it for this.  Here's a slick mapping that will do the work of creating Matlabby ""paths"":

```
inoremap &lt;expr&gt; &lt;c-x&gt;&lt;c-m&gt; fzf#vim#complete(
    \ ""find . -type f \\( -name '*.m' \\) -print \| sed '1d;s:^..::;s/\\/+/./g;s/^+//;s/\\.m$//;s/\\/@.\\+\\//./;s/\\//./g'"")

All it does is read your current directory to find all the .m files, reformat to the Matlab style with sed, then use FZF.

However, I've recently felt the need to open multiple `terminal` splits per project so I've been trying to come up with a different solution to support this.

&amp;#x200B;

The approach has been to define a set of commands that can be used to open new horizontal/vertical `terminal` splits from already existing ones only. The functions that these commands call will then store information in a list about how each buffer was opened, the buffer number, etc. Then, the toggling process is as simple as determining if the set of terminal windows is open, going to each, and executing `hide`. Otherwise, if they aren't showing I can simply iterate through the list and open them in the same order, producing the same layout as before. The list might look like:

    [{'bufnr': 2, 'type': 'root'}, {'bufnr': 3, 'type': 'v'}, {'bufnr': 4, 'type': 'h'}]

This is all fine and dandy as long as the only `terminal` buffers that are closed are the ones at the end of the list. I have some special logic to deal with closing ones in the middle, but there are *way* too many edge cases in this simplistic method I've come up with.

&amp;#x200B;

The point in this post is to look for advice on the best way to achieve what I want, or discover something better that already exists.

I want to use vim at my new job but there are some problems and I would like your suggestions on how to approach them.

First of all, allow me to explain my setup. There are some servers running our product. Those servers are not running linux but actually another version of unix with different architectures. Due do those problems, I can't compile/run the code/tests in my dev machine, I have to connect to one of the machines we have available to compile/run what we're building and do it over there. 

My first/current solution was to use a vim-sftp plugin and once I save my files on vim it uploads it to the server and I just alt+tab to my terminal emulator connected to it and do what I need. 

This solution has been working for a few months now but I'm running into some problems with YouCompleteMe and some other different auto-completion plugins that I tried. Since all the files/dependencies don't exist in linux (that's why I can't compile it locally), I downloaded the source files and told YCM to use them as dependencies. Unfortunately, some things don't work properly, like the GoToDefinition, etc. At least 50% of the time it doesn't work.

I did set up the remotely machine so I could develop on it. There, I could just use the compile\_commands.json that cmake did output for me. I tried ALE with that and it works flawlessly. The bad thing is that developing remotely is reaaally slow and I just can't keep doing that.

Sorry if this is too big, I just tried to explain as much as I could.

TL;DR/Long story short: The software I'm working with only compiles in some machines because they have dependencies unavailable on linux, so, I have to develop locally, push my files to the remote machine and build/run tests over there. I want to have a good auto complete like YCM/ALE while I'm coding locally.",Editing remote files,0

Of course, I could ask the authors for help or maintain my own fork however I wonder if there is a simpler and less intrusive way? For instance, can I teach vim to simply use my `:SPlist` command whenever it needs to execute a `:split` or `:vsplit` command? To my understanding, the split commands can be issued in two ways:

1. via vim's commandline
2. internally from a vimscript using the `execute` command

Solution for 1. is simply a matter of introducing a commandline map, it's 2. that I am not sure about and need help with. Any guidance is much appreciated!

I recently wrote an article why and how using tmux. Since tmux works very well with Vim, I thought it might interest some of you in this subreddit.

When I first discovered tmux, it changed basically all my worklows (from programming to writing), for the better.

This tool can allow you to divide your terminal in multiple shells, control entirely your terminal with your keyboard (using the mouse is possible too), run scripts in the background and much more!

In this new article from my blog, I describe:

* Why should we use tmux?
* How to use tmux? How does it work?
* A basic configuration for you to understand how to configure tmux for your own needs.
* How to extend tmux possibilities with plugins

I have been using Vim daily for a little more than a year now, and although I think I am ""fluent"" enough for most of my daily tasks, I have noticed that I have not been progressing much (as in learning new commands or new usages of commands I already know) over the last few months.

To solve that, I decided to read more of the details of the documentation and put them in practice.

I started with the `:substitute` command and wrote a little article on what I didn't know before but found useful over the past week or so (I am sure the rest has its uses too... I just did not find any!).

I talk about:

* The `g`/`c`/`n`/`&amp;`/`r` flags
* Repeating substitutions, including the difference between repeating a *search* pattern and repeating a `substitute` pattern
* Using `\=` to do fancier replacements

While this is mostly aimed at fellow ""intermediate"" vimmers and might seem obvious to more experienced ones, any feedback would be greatly appreciated (especially since it's my first time writing about Vim)!

My biggest problems with it:

- Too many integrations for too many plugins I don't use
- Integrates through global variables with a fixed list of plugins (no interface to integrate a plugin that isn't on the list)
- Colored in its own way, so you need to use colorschemes that vim-airline-themes plays well with
- I don't really like Unix ricing culture, beyond the basics;  too many rices add dependencies that ruin a system's performance, portability and minimalism/usability (case in point, a thousands-line codebase for a fancy statusline is pretty ridiculous, IMO)

Really, I only need a couple of things on top of the stock statusline:

- Integration with Fugitive to show me which Git branch I'm on
- Integration with Obsession to show me whether or not I'm in a session
- Display filetype
- Don't include too much of anything I don't need

Therefore, I've taken on Tim Pope's [vim-flagship](https://github.com/tpope/vim-flagship), which I'm much happier with. I get to use autocmds instead of the oddly C-biased quasi-scanf interface that Bram decides to tack onto everything, and I get a few other global variables that I can mess with.

For anyone who uses Airline/Lightline, but is willing to rethink how much value the rice actually adds and might consider something with a smaller footprint, I highly recommend you take a look at the stock statusline.

If we're at the end of the line, then what's the point of checking anything starting from `col+1`? It seems to me there is no condition in which `col == col('$')` is true and only the open bracket is returned.

`&lt;leader&gt;l` will search for the next help link and `&lt;leader&gt;h` will search for a heading. As they are just searches you can keep jumping to the next link using `n` and back with `N`. Pressing `q` just quits. `Enter` jumps to a link and backspace goes back. So many plugin help files start with a contents page so I find myself doing `&lt;leader&gt;l` followed by (count)`n` to go to the link, hit `&lt;CR&gt;` read a bit hit `&lt;BS&gt;` then do (count)`n` again to go to then next link and so on.

The canonical way of doing these mappings would be to add it as a filetype in .vim/ftplugin but I like to keep everything in my .vimrc.

I love vim, the reality is that I love vim mode. I'm a mechanical keyboard fan (to the level that I compile my own firmware for them) and the more I use the keyboard, the happier that I am.

I like vim ideas so much that I even translated some of the vim idioms to my keyboard firmware. I have a leader key, I don't need to hold modifiers to perform most actions and I even have some macros.

Then, what is what I find about vim frustrating? The fact that I can only use it for certain kind of tasks.

I'm a also a programmer and I have some dozens of devices on my home network (NAS, raspberry pi, etc) .

The thing is that vim is probably the fatest editor I can use when it comes to edit configuration files. It feels so awesome to just type \`ciw\` to replace an entire word and move one line down and just repeat by pressing dot. I feel like a magician using vim and it is an awesome experience. 

However, I feel like a completely different person when I try to edit code using vim style: The problem I have to fix becomes a secondary problem and I spent most of the time thinking about which vim command should I type to the level that I am almost unable to write any useful code using vim.

I tried all kind of editors with vim emulation, spacemacs, vim with dozens of plugins.... but nothing seems to make vim suitable for coding ( in my personal situation of course).

It is very frustrating because I want to  use vim in as many aspects of my life as I could, but every time I try to use it on my actual daily job I fail, and It's been like this for years (almost a decade)

So what frustrates me about vim is that it is my favorite editor, but I can not use it as much as I could... Recently I invested money in Onivim 2 to see if it fulfills the promise of brin vim to the modern editor era...

After adding the after/ftplugin/vimwiki.vim file with the content

when I open a vimwiki note (or a diary entry or the wiki index) the syntax is still set to vimwiki. The output of the command :verb set syntax? is:

Last set from /usr/share/nvim/runtime/syntax/syntax.vim

If I then refresh the file with :e or open a new window and come back to the vimwiki buffer then the autocommand is triggered and the syntax is set to markdown.

My impression is that the autocomand set with the ftplugin file is set but has no effect until you enter the buffer the next time.

Can anyone throw some light on this and help me fix the problem?

For context, I haven't dived head-first into terminal vim, instead opting for the extension available in VS code. This fluidity gained has not been without exception . I have been trying to do things the vim way mostly, and have found the non-vim way to be superior in certain circumstances.

For instance, copying and pasting with cmd+c and cmd+v is just so much smoother when it's a quick operation. For comparison, the vim way would be to yank a word into the clipboard register, then paste it somewhere (eg. search). This operation is \`""+yiw\` just to copy. Is it really quicker the vim way?

With something like vim it would be perfectly understandable that the learning is slow at the beginning, but if you subscribe to the vim way entirely, you will have speed gains in all areas. However, I still don't see how 5 keystrokes could possibly be preferable to \`cmd + c\`

The way I see it, vim's main draw is saving keystrokes and allowing you to edit in a way that is more declarative. I don't see either of these aims being fulfilled by doing things the vim way.

Here are some other non-vim methods I have been preferring:

* \`cmd + /\` to comment out lines, rather than \`gcc\`
* \`cmd + shift + f\` to search an entire directory
* \`option + up/down\` to move entire lines","Using vim IDE extensions, should we strictly follow vim methods?",0

- install relevant plugins (I use vim-plug):
```

        \ 'cmd': {server_info-&gt;['pyls']},

In short, I'd like to use a command that either opens a file, or if the file is already opened, switches to the tab/window containing the file -- `:drop` seems to fit this. The issue I have is that `:drop` overwrites the argument list with whatever file it receives, and I'd like to preserve the args list.

I came up with a custom function, particularly for editing my vimrc, that essentially saves the args list, `:drop`s into the file, and then restores the args list:

    function! DropPreserveArgs()
      let s:args = argv()
      drop $MYVIMRC
    
      "" I can't just use :args here because 
      "" that would switch to the first file in the list
      argdelete *
      exe ""argadd "".join(map(s:args, {_, arg -&gt; escape(arg, ' ')}))

      unlet s:args
    endfunction

I'm doing the string processing in `argadd` because `argv()` retrieves the args with unescaped spaces, and `:argadd` accepts space-separated paths.

It works, but what I'm doing is super inefficient and could take a while with a large list.  I feel like there *has* to be a better way, I just haven't found it. I tried to google for a solution but either I'm the first one with this problem (unlikely), or I can't find the right words to search. So I figured I'd ask here.

Ever since then, I've grown to like my setup, and I would like to move to the next level by trying to use pure vim. The issue is that even though I know how to edit a text file with vim quite well, I know nothing about moving beyond the concept of a single text file. I mean things like:

- how open files, move between them, search a specific one in a project, etc.
- how to move in an ide like manner (things like go to a function's definition, or check where a function is being called, in a project-wide level)
- how to keep several files visible at the same time, resize the panes, move between them, etc
- how to interact with a terminal
- how to use a debugger, if it's possible

I think you get the idea. I've tried to find information about it, but most of what I find is just either 101 basic tutorials for using  as a  text editor (the part I already know), or people sharing their very opinionated setups with a dozen plugins tailored to their liking.

I just found out that experimental support for Vim9 script [has been merged](https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/5530) to Vim's master branch.  Vim9 script is an entirely new version of the Vim programming language.  The differences are documented [in a help file](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/doc/vim9.txt).  Among other things it features:

* A new function declaration syntax with new semantics
* New more efficient calling conventions for functions using the new declaration syntax
* New scoping rules and semantics for `let`
* Optional static typing
* `import`, `export`
* Classes

## My feelings for the changes

I personally dislike these changes.  Vim script is a language with a few quirks, which can take a while to learn to use efficiently.  Now there will be two different version of the language coexisting with different syntax and semantics.  I personally think the original Vim script worked quite well for its use case if one took the time to learn it, and it seems to me that the direction is to make it more into a general purpose programming language, which I think it shouldn't be.

I was initially excited when reading the announcement on what is being worked on for Vim9, which included improving Vim script as a language and improving its performance.  But this wasn't what I expected.

## My Expectation for optimizing Vimscript

I had more expected that they would optimize existing Vim script code.  Like making a function like the following:

    func Sum(list)
        let sum = 0
        for i in a:list
            let sum += i
        endfor
        return sum
    endfunc

Be optimized so that the argument won't be passed by dictionaries anymore, which I thought would be possible to do with a smarter compiler.

## Some reason why I don't the Vim9 script approach

The old Vim script from thousands of plug ins will never go away, so both languages has to coexist.  I think this will be quite bad and confusing for people who want to learn Vim script and have different versions which different semantics.  I also don't want to have to relearn everything to get the performance improvements by the new calling conventions.

As a developer who have released [one plugin](https://github.com/ryvnf/readline.vim).  I feel like it still makes more sense to code in the regular Vim script to preserve compatibility with older Vim versions.  For most plugins the performance improvement of Vim9 script probably isn't worth sacrificing compatibility for.  I probably think there are other plugin creators think the same.  This will probably also stand in the way for widespread adoption of Vim9 script.

## Ending

I liked Vim script for what it was, even with its quirks.  Vim9 script feels like an attempt to strap a general purpose language on to it.  This makes me feel a bit sad and disappointed.  I would have wanted improvements to Vim script which were backward compatible instead, not something that would require learning a new language.  There are already other general purpose languages like Go which is getting used more and more to create Vim plugins.

It also seems sad to me that the thousands of existing plugins will see no noticeable performance improvements, as the focus has been to make Vim9 script fast.

Sorry, if this is a bit ranty.  This change wasn't the way I expected.  Sense it has already been merged, it probably isn't going to change.  Still, I feel like I wanted to write my opinions and maybe hear your opinion.

## My Expectation for optimizing Vimscript

I had more expected that they would optimize existing Vim script code.  Like making a function like the following:

    func Sum(list)
        let sum = 0
        for i in a:list
            let sum += i
        endfor
        return sum
    endfunc

Be optimized so that the argument won't be passed by dictionaries anymore, which I thought would be possible to do with a smarter compiler.

## Some reason why I don't the Vim9 script approach

The old Vim script from thousands of plug ins will never go away, so both languages has to coexist.  I think this will be quite bad and confusing for people who want to learn Vim script and have different versions which different semantics.  I also don't want to have to relearn everything to get the performance improvements by the new calling conventions.

As a developer who have released [one plugin](https://github.com/ryvnf/readline.vim).  I feel like it still makes more sense to code in the regular Vim script to preserve compatibility with older Vim versions.  For most plugins the performance improvement of Vim9 script probably isn't worth sacrificing compatibility for.  I probably think there are other plugin creators think the same.  This will probably also stand in the way for widespread adoption of Vim9 script.

## Ending

I liked Vim script for what it was, even with its quirks.  Vim9 script feels like an attempt to strap a general purpose language on to it.  This makes me feel a bit sad and disappointed.  I would have wanted improvements to Vim script which were backward compatible instead, not something that would require learning a new language.  There are already other general purpose languages like Go which is getting used more and more to create Vim plugins.

It also seems sad to me that the thousands of existing plugins will see no noticeable performance improvements, as the focus has been to make Vim9 script fast.

Sorry, if this is a bit ranty.  This change wasn't the way I expected.  Sense it has already been merged, it probably isn't going to change.  Still, I feel like I wanted to write my opinions and maybe hear your opinion.

**TL;DR** I have mixed feelings for the addition of Vim9 script which was recently merged to Vim's master branch",I have mixed feelings for Vim9 script. What do you think about it?,0

They call this a guide buffer and is a very helpful feature to me.

For now, I have just found a \[stackoverflow answer\]([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24842063/how-to-search-in-the-vim-mapping-listing/38735360#38735360](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24842063/how-to-search-in-the-vim-mapping-listing/38735360#38735360)) that describes how to create a vertical split that shows your mappings.

My question is, if there is a plugin out there that provides this functionality or at least gives you some assistance in creating such a guide?

**What is the best way to frequently send small amounts of information to a running program?**
It should preferably not require synchronization/blocking on either end.

# Current VIM solution
My quick-and-dirty solution is to write to a `cursor.pos` file on the `CursorMoved` autocmd that I can `scanf` from my program. This works, but noticeably slows down the editor when moving e.g. across multiple lines.

# Solutions for other editors
In Notepad++ plugins are DLLs (`.so` equivalent for Windows), so I can use the standard [interprocess communication tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/interprocess-communications) available through the Windows API in C(++). I currently have it using a named pipe between the plugin and my software, which seems to work without noticeable slowdown.

I never tried Vim and I thought I'd give a shot! BUT! I have spend TONS of hours on configuring Emacs the last month (trust me, you have NO idea how many). And I don't want to do the same with Vim and then get disappointed in the end. So I'm gonna make some questions and thanks for anyone that will spend their time to answer me!

1. How does Emacs compare Vim. I've heard people saying that Emacs is more powerful than Vim? Is that true? And if yes, what Emacs can't do that Emacs can. I have to be clear tho. I'm not talking about thing like being able to open a terminal inside emacs, a browser etc. I'm only talking about text and programming related stuff!

2. A small list. How Vim does on this things? 

* Does Vim has a beautiful UI, including a bottom line, a beautiful theme (in the atom colors) etc.
* What about Live syntax error checking and highlight (SUPER IMPORTANT)?
* Auto complete (not so important but it would be cool)?
* Does Vim has Snippets like Emac's Yasnippet (ALSO VERY IMPORTANT)?
* Does Vim let's you remap EVERY single key? I don't like HJKL for example and i want to use IJKL
* How the window (spited screen) and buffer (opened files) system work on emacs?
* Are there packages that expend Vim's capabilities like on emacs or something similar?

3. Can Vim be a powerful, fully capable IDE for every language as Emacs? On of the reasons I've chosen Emacs when I was founding for an Editor about a month ago is that people said Vim is great for small editing and Emacs is great to used as a powerful programing Editor/IDE. After using Emacs I can confirm the Emacs part but I want people to tell me about the fully capabilities of VIM!

When I published my last article about \`:substitute\`, among all the [nice feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/epig4f/learn_about_the_darker_corners_of_substitute/) I got (thanks again!), some people mentioned that I was not talking about ranges and addresses enough.

This made me realize that I didn't know much about that topic, so I did my research and came up with this new post, in which I talk about:

* What is exactly an address, a range, and what are the differences
* Some text editor history (!) and how addresses came to be what they are today
* Some quirks of ranges, and a few shortcuts

Although I do talk about a few bindings/commands that I found useful, I'm more focusing on going in depth and clearing up the confusion that I saw pop up between ranges and addresses. I hope you'll like it.

As always, I would love any feedback you guys can give me!

Long time Vi(m) user since the Irix times on SGI machines.  
A couple of weeks ago, I finally decided to spend some time digging a bit more into customizing Vim (thanks, random post on r/vimporn!) and I feel like I've discovered a new world. 

I am sincerely impressed by the amount of functionality that can be achieved just by using the Vim scripting language.

With that, of course, comes a bit of frustration because there's a jungle of choices, options, and customizations.

At this point I think I've settled with a minimal set of plugins that gives me pretty much what I need, basically: Nerdtree, autopairs, and vim-lsp with asyncomplete.

The autocomplete so far is the most annoying bit, since I can't manage to find peace. Initially, I've tried jedi, but the lag was killing it for me, so when I discovered the combo vim-lsp/asyncomplete I was really happy... for a while.

I realized that with vim-lsp I couldn't show one of the most useful features that I found in jedi: realtime function signature preview, as I type. The pic show that I can see the signature of the functions for some modules (not for SWIG wrapped ones, for example?), this disappear after selecting the suggestion.

I heard there might be issues with the autopairs, but I've tried disabling it with no avail.

I've been incredibly busy with (very good and very positive) life stuff over the past year, so I haven't had much time for managing ALE. I think I'm finally getting to a point where I don't have to be nearly as busy any more, so I can finally work on ALE again. I just made the decision to delete all 424 unread emails in my ""ALE"" email inbox and start again, so I can actually get back on top of emails again.

I'll install the ""stale"" bot for pull requests _only_ so they either get merged or closed from now on, and I'll try to focus on making the improvements to ALE that I want the most, as that's what I'm best at. If anyone wants to help out with managing issues or pull requests, just leave a reply here, a private message on Reddit, or drop me an email at dev@w0rp.com, and we can discuss it.

So for this paragraph which contains no hard wraps, if I was writing this in Vim, I couldn't just use the arrow keys to go up to the word directly above this one (""was"").

About 400,000 words across 500 files.

One thing that bugged me in the past was linking between notes, so I can chain ideas together (have tried in the past, but inspired recently by watching [How to take smart notes](https://vimeo.com/275530205)). Despite using vim for about 8 years, I've never really put much effort into writing my own vimscript. That's changed lately, which led to an epiphany...

    function! s:copy_filename_as_mdlink()
        let fname=expand(""%"")
        let @a=""["" . fname . ""](./"" . fname. "")""
    endfunction
    autocommand BufLeave * call s:copy_filename_as_mdlink()

Then, whenever I change buffer, I *automatically* copy the name of the file I was just in, letting me either `""ap` to paste the contents of the `a` register (where I've just created a markdown link), or more typically, `&lt;c-r&gt;a`, to paste the `a` buffer while in insert-mode.

I *may* even extend this process with something like:

    au BufNewFile *.md,*.txt execute 'normal ""ap'

To automatically insert the link to the file I just came from... (or maybe I'll wrap `:e` so that I can do this optionally...)

I figured out that *indentexpr* is causing my *auto-indentation*, because when I `:set indentexpr=""""`, the *auto-indentation* is all gone, but I'm not setting it anywhere in my [*vimrc*](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/9TPt36tZq2/) file.

I've also [read online](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18671756/11943796) that `filetype plugin on`*(33)* **might** be causing this, but when I remove it, **nothing** changes.

After testing a bit, I found, that by removing these lines*(35-39)* in my [*vimrc*](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/9TPt36tZq2/) file:

    call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
        ...
    call plug#end()

The *auto-indentation* is **gone**! Which must mean, that either my plugins, or my [*vim-plug*](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is causing the *auto-indentation*. After some further testing, by deleting all the plugins, I debunked the possibility of plugins causing this, so this means, that actually my [*vim-plug*](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is causing this!

But the thing that bothers me the most is, that with this *auto-indentation*, when I type in &lt;(-CR&gt; in a *python* file, **two new indentations are added in a new line**, [**wtf**](https://findtheinvisiblecow.com/)? The reason it bothers me so much, is that my [parentheses auto-completion plugin](https://github.com/cohama/lexima.vim)'s *(I used to use lexima, but it's too much for me)* feature, where &lt;(-CR&gt; should close the parentheses in a new line, **with no indentation**, instead adds two new indentation lines, in a new line.

As far as I know, **no** python style-guide allows this, so why would this happen?  Also, in a **python** file,  `:set verbose indentexpr?` returns `.../vim/vim80/indent/python.vim`, which means that **no** plugins are interfering with the auto-indentation.

# So my questions are:

* Why is *indentexpr* automatically set in my vim?
* Why doesn't autoindent do anything when *indentexpr* is not set?
* Why does vim-plug cause auto-indentations and how do I tell it not to?
* Why would &lt;(-CR&gt; add two new indentations in a new line and is it possible to fix it, if so, how?

**Some keynotes:** I'm not new to vim, but I just as of recently started using vim as my daily driver and started building my dotvim. Any help is appreciated!

This works great but I pulled it from the Goyo plugin site so naturally there a few things I'm not completely tracking on. Specifically this confusion is in relation to the following pieces...  
* What is`:s` in the statement `function! s:goyo_enter()` mean?
* What is `b:quitting` and `b:quitting_bang`?  
* What is `User` in the autocmd statement?  
* Why use `nested call` and not `call`?  
* What is `&lt;SID&gt;`?  

... This is keeping me from figuring out how to define another function for the [pencil](https://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil) plugin I'm using for editing markdown files. I'm just lost on how to invoke a few simple things by wrapping them in a function. Here is what I want this function to contain...  
```
function! pencil_enter()
    let g:pencil#wrapModeDefault = 'soft'
    call pencil#init()
endfunction
```

I'm just lost on whether I need to define the function as `s:configure_pencil()` and what else I need to throw in it. I'm also lost on how to structure a `autocmd!` for it like I have for goyo_enter(). I don't know if I need `User`, a `nested call` or `call` and what event to use in the `autocmd` to trigger a call to my function `pencil_enter()`. Could I get some help please?  

# __UPDATE/SOLVED__  
# __Ah ha, got it!__  
_If there's a better convention please correct me_. However, is what I did.  

I went to the [vim-pencil](https://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil) repo and looked at the [plugin/pencil.vim](https://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil/blob/master/plugin/pencil.vim) file. I looked at the command section of that file and assumed (hope this is correct) that a command is what is referred to as a event (aka action) that I can tie my autocmd to. Kind of like what happens with goyo_enter().  

I then created a little keymap in my `~/.vim/vimrc` as `map &lt;C-p&gt; :Pencil&lt;CR&gt;`. Then I created the following function in `~/.vim/ftplugin/markdown.vim`.  
```
function! s:pencil_enter()
    let g:pencil#wrapModeDefault = 'soft'
    call pencil#init()
endfunction
```
I then created a little autocmd for it which I assume this will call the function `s:pencil_enter()` whenever the event `Pencil` happens which is tied to the keymap `Ctrl-p`.  
```
autocmd! User Pencil nested call &lt;SID&gt;pencil_enter()
```

[from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/9vsdmr/setting_up_on_macos/e9f43cx/)

I currently use vs-code and vim for quick edits, though I have found myself using vim a bit more lately. I've been familiar with vim keys for quite a while, and couldn't really do without them now. 

I'm currently going through a few system related things ( changing BSD to GNU stuff in OSX ), and that has led to me looking at vim installs as a result of the message: 

```
vim: stable 8.2.0250 (bottled), HEAD
Vi 'workalike' with many additional features
https://www.vim.org/
Conflicts with:
  ex-vi (because vim and ex-vi both install bin/ex and bin/view)
  macvim (because vim and macvim both install vi* binaries)
Not installed
```


That's a bit of context, and to let the reader know that I'm not completely new to vim. What I'm wondering about though is the title - why would I thank someone for using neovim instead? I thought that it (neovim) was meant to support devs more if they wanted to embed vim or something, but I don't really understand what the benefit would be for myself. 

I hope this isn't a classic flamewar type question, it's not intended to be.

* hit `Escape` to go to normal mode
* Hit a keyboard combination mapped to a command/function
* Have the entire current line passed as command-line arguments to an external command
* Have the entire current line _replaced_ by the output of the command.

[Here](https://youtu.be/jolcXYdLSAU) is a video demonstrating exactly what I want it to look like. In the video, however, the _entire buffer_ is passed through an external command, the one line is replaced, and the _entire buffer_ is replaced. I just want to read/replace the single line.

The goal is to use snippets, but set values.

For example, this works:

    nnoremap ,html :-1read $HOME/.vim/template.html&lt;CR&gt;

This allows me to add the contents of `template.html` at the location of my cursor by typing `,html` in normal mode. However, I _only_ get the contents of `template.html` -- I can't use any placeholders.

What I'd like to do is type some words on the current line in vim:

    apple banana

press a key combination, and have it replaced with this:

    func apple(s string) string {
        return s + "" banana""

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

What follows is a plugin question, and yes I've read the doc, and yes I posted on the github issues page, but I bet there's someone here who has a lurking mapping or two with the answer.

# What is a Zettelkasten?

Good question.  Read the post above and watch some videos :).  In the most boiled down sense, it's atomic notes with tags and forward/backward links to related notes.

# What are the challenges of a Vim implementation?

Several.  Auto-generation of back links, maintaining a list of tags, a search mechanism to insert relevant links, and some handy expansions and templates to keep it fast.

# Ok so what's the question?

Rather than solve this all in Vim, I did some of it in bash for the sake of portability (also because the bash utilities are fast).

I have a tag list in a file that is unique, and I want to complete from it with FZF.  This command will do that in the shell:
```
fzf --no-preview --print-query &lt; ztags
```
and this command is close with fzf.vim:
```
inoremap &lt;expr&gt; &lt;c-x&gt;&lt;c-t&gt; fzf#vim#complete(fzf#wrap({
    \ 'source': 'cat ~/zettest/ztags'}))
```
Notably though, it doesn't include the `--print-query` option which is essential for creating new tags rapidly.  You SHOULD be able to add a bit like ` 'options':'--print-query'}` but it doesn't work.  Does anybody know where I went sideways?

# Bonus question

What I would really like is to get this working, and have it auto-trigger when you enter the tabstop for entering tags in UltiSnips.  I think that would require a post-complete or post-jump in UltiSnips, but that's not quite right either.  Any overachiever have that answer?

Thanks in advance!  If/when I get this done, I'll post up the end product and a demo video.",Madness with fzf.vim and UltiSnips,0

I've just recently started using vim. I find the duality of operators and motions very intuitive: it feels perfectly sensible that many of the commands I type have the form ""thing I want to do"" plus ""region I wish to be affected"".

However, the :s command, which is used to find one thing and replace it with another, seems to be an exception to this elegant rule. Although I can type ""**d**10j"" to delete a ten-line function, I cannot type ""**:s/foo/bar/**10j"" to replace ""foo"" with ""bar"" in a ten-line function.

As far as I can tell, this is a fairly simple concept. All that vim would need to do is consider strings of the form "":s/.../.../"" to be operators with normal operator grammar.

Why doesn't vim do this?

Here are some possible answers I'm anticipating, all of which I would consider excellent as long as they are true:

* ""There is a command that works like that, it's \[blah\]""
* ""There's no good reason. You can make a command that works like that by putting \[blah\] in your .vimrc file.""

&gt; Don't forget to press &lt;Enter&gt; to finish the command.
For those of you interested in the details, the three parts of this command
are the colon (:), which enters Command-line mode; the q command, which tells
the editor to quit; and the override command modifier (!).
The override command modifier is needed because Vim is reluctant to throw
away changes. If you were to just type "":q"", Vim would display an error
message and refuse to exit:
E37: No write since last change (use ! to override)
By specifying the override, you are in effect telling Vim, ""I know that what
I'm doing looks stupid, but I'm a big boy and really want to do this.""
If you want to continue editing with Vim: The "":e!"" command reloads the
original version of the file.

But adding ! didn't do anything. After entering

&gt; :e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor!

I got the same error:

This solution has lots of room for improvement: only produce colours for months in use, limit number of colours and chunking dates together, generate nicer sets of colours.

Before I go further, I hoped someone here might know of an existing solution?

I checked some existing plugins:

* Fugitive does something completely different: it tries to [represent hash values as colours](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/blob/master/autoload/fugitive.vim#L5498-L5516).
* vc.vim doesn't do any different colours.

After writing LaTeX in Overleaf this past year, and in VS Code the last two months i'm thinking about switching to Vim. However as someone that hasn't coded a line in my life except editing commands from LaTeX packages im finding it difficult simply setting up Vim so that i can begin actually doing stuff. 

As of writing this post i have downloaded and installed MacVim (im on Mac) and downloaded Vim-Latex which most people say is the way to go as far as i know, however i have also found something called Vimtex on github. Whatever is the best i still dont know how to install it on Vim yet. What i need help with is setting up Vim, so that i can do note taking and assignments, like i usually do in LaTeX, and maybe some material on how to get the most out of Vim, such as installing plug-ins and writing snippets. 

Considering that im having trouble at this stage should i just quit on Vim, and keep on using VS code? Atom also seems viable and has a guide on the setup on youtube so thats also something im considering.

Short term goals: 

1. Setup Vim (LaTeX capability, Pdf Viewer)
2. Write LaTeX files in Vim 
3. Setup a master preamble that all my .tex files use
4. Setup a good file management for different Courses and Semesters
5. be able do install plugins

The crux of the issue seems to come down to choosing one of the following two inner branches to match either a field that is not quoted, or one that is:

    [^''][^,]*

and:

    ''\%(''''\|[^'']\)*''

If I use only one of these sub-patterns I'm able to match successfully, however combining the two seems to fail for some reason. I've tried every variety of lookaround I can think of to no avail. At this point, I'm ready to give up using an expression and switch to a pushdown automaton.

So I've been working on [Vimkubectl](https://github.com/rottencandy/vimkubectl), a plugin to view and edit any valid Kubernetes resource.

I'm a huge fan of tpope's `Fugitive.vim`, so I modeled Vimkubectl's workflow in a similar way. It provides commands to view, edit, delete and save any resource considered valid by your Kubernetes cluster, including CRDs.

I'm currently exploring the possibilities of adding async features, displaying additional object status, or maybe the ability to view pod logs.

From my tests this only happens if you are using taskwiki's markdown mode - with normal vimwiki syntax, everything works fine.

So, what are the ways in which Vim (not vi) is better than Emacs? I want to keep using Vim but the pressure to switch to Emacs is just irresistible given the extra features and cool stuff it can do. So, any answers describing the reasons one should keep using Vim and not Emacs are welcome. Opinionated/biased answers especially welcome.",How’s Vim better than Emacs?,0

I read the vim documentation about splits, and there is no way to create a new split on the left side. Not to mention that it creates an empty buffer that I don't want.

And most troublingly, for half of the matches patterns I'm defining, *omitting* the **contained** option results in significantly faster matching.

For more info, this program runs recursively: it takes the file contents as a string, and calls itself on disjoint substrings whenever it finds a match pattern.

I don't understand why this happens. Isn't the server connected with the file itself?

In real time I would have multiple windows open and I will change between them and I can't have to server to always break.

\- `(\d\+\)px` \- finds strings like ""3px"" and ""234px"", captures the digits

\- `=printf(""%f"", (submatch(1) / 16.0)).""rem""` \- an expression that takes the captured group (`submatch(1)`), divide it by 16 (which is my base font) and concats with ""rem"".

I tried to make Vim the default app for opening plain text files, both with `xdg-open` from terminal, and from GUI file manager. So, I copied the `vim.desktop` file to `~/.local/share/applications/` and edited it with `Terminal=false` and `Exec=mate-terminal -x vim %F`. It now works nicely both from file manager and from terminal, but there is a strange oddity.

When I open a file with `xdg-open /path/to/file &amp; disown` it opens in a new window as expected and I can close the original terminal. But if I want to autoclose the terminal, by appending `; exit` to said alias, then after closing the vim-opened terminal window, shortly after a read-only vim window opens with same file, and after closing this one yet another, this time gVim, window opens. However, if I delay the exit with `sleep 1` beforehand, the extra windows don't open. This is problematic for me because I'm also using a function that feeds `find` result to `fzf`, which then feeds it to such `xdg-open` and then at the end of the function, it `exit` 's since I want the terminal to close when a chosen file opens.

A stupid workaround is to just delay the exit with `sleep` but it seems rather random, for example for a small value like `sleep 0.3` the extra windows sometimes open and sometimes not. I'm curous for a proper solution and explanation why this happens at all.",xdg-open oddity,0

Finally, after many attempts I'm an (almost) full time vim user.

However, there is still one thing I miss, and it is the ability to usage mnemonics and some visual clues to not have to remember hundreds of keymaps.

What I do usually on VSCode is to just open the omnibar and type whatever I remember from what I want to do, and when I see a result that matches I hit enter and the command is executed.

Doom Emacs and Spacemacs has something close, which is a bottom bar that, once you press space it displays the next tree of options and continues that way until you hit a command.

&amp;#x200B;

I have some things that are close to it, but they are not quite there. For example:   


* I have fzf.vim configured for showing me a fuzzy search of all the available commands, sadly such commands does not have a description, so unless the name is fantastic you will have a bad time discovering commands
* I also have fzf.vim configured for discovering keymaps on a fuzzy way (this is extremely helpful)
* I have installed neoclide COC and coc.lists. They have a fuzzy searcher, but there is one for each kind of thing. So if you want to search for a command you need a keymap for triggering commands, an action? same thing. Usually don't remember in which category falls what I want to use
* And finally there is FZCOC, which uses fzf to wrap coc.lists, but they have the same limitations

So, currently what I do is trigger fzf.vim with commands, Trigger the command that I want (which may open a new popup if it is another list of commands), then search the command and finally execute it. This are so many steps, and I am looking for a more unified experience, where all the commands, along with optional descriptions are in the same place.

I don't mind, for example, If I have to install more coc plugins to put everything under the COC umbrella (for example, git stuff instead of using fugitive), but I don't know if there is such a set of plugins that can work together.

So I am now looking for a new LSP server to use as my backend for c++ development.  Quick backstory: previously I was using cquery as it was working perfectly fine for the legacy project I was working on and had minimal dependencies.  I now am working on a modern c++ project where cquery crashs when trying to cache the compile commands json file.  Looking at: [https://langserver.org/](https://langserver.org/) there are two other options: ccls (which the last time I tried to install on ubuntu 16.04 there was dependency problems) and clangd.  I tried clangd and while it attempts to work on the new codebase, it completely chokes on 80% of the searches (I believe this may be due to the heavy use of the ""using"" keywork?).

I opened VSCode and noticed that the LSP server they are using successfully works on our codebase.  With the promise of LSP being portability of the language servers, I am wondering if anyone knows if we can use their language server in vim?

```

Because, I embed the path in my prompt, I can use it to avoid nesting Vim sessions when opening files I'm interested in. Here is the code I use for that:

```
function! s:TermGetPath() abort
    return fnameescape(substitute(getline(line('.')-1), '\v\S+\s\[(.*)\].*$', '\1', ''))

function! s:TermFileBrowse(cmd) abort

Similarly, I can use `&lt;C-p&gt;` to open FZF for fuzzy searching in the `path` directory. Or, I can simply switch to normal mode in the terminal, move my cursor on top of a file name and hit vanilla `open file under the cursor` commands (`gf`, `&lt;C-w&gt;f`) to open the file in my current VIM session regardless of where the `path` points to.",Tips for avoiding nested Vim sessions when opening files in the integrated terminal.,0

I've noticed that when I save a file the ALE linter would take a long time to display any errors.

    function! Make_window(prefix)

can I edit a remote file in vim that needs the remote user to use `sudo` / `sudoedit`? 

## Scenario

* pc 1: my local desktop
* pc 2: remote headless server, user has root rights **but** needs `sudo` or `sudoedit` to edit files in, for example, `/etc/`
* I want to edit `/etc/cups/cupsd.conf` **from** pc 1 **on** pc 2 ***without*** `ssh`ing into it first

Normally (*for files I can regularly edit*) I would `vim scp://user@host//home/that_user/some_file.tmp`. However, I cannot `vim scp://user@host//etc/cups/cupsd.conf`, as the user does not have sufficient rights to edit the file without `sudoedit`. 

Yes, I **could** `ssh user@host`, then `sudoedit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf`, but you know how it is. Your local vim is always the best vim. I have *part* of my `.vimrc` on **that** remote host, but certainly not on all my remote hosts; so if I could somehow use my local vim for edition any file on any host, that would make my workflow so much easier.

I version control them with git. I often have a few (long, technical) words or phrases which come up often in that essay, but not whenever else I am writing, so it's useful to have a list of abbreviations specific to that essay. In practice I have lots of different files in the repo (a plan, a bibliography, maybe subplans, an abstract etc.) all of which the abbreviations would be useful for.

At the moment I just have a dir in my git repo called `.ignore/` (which I tell git to ignore), and put a file called `abbreviations` with my abbreviations in that, then source it from .vimrc. When the essay is done, I delete the source line (but I keep the file and the gir repo, because I keep all of my old essays). 

This works but it isn't very elegant, takes time, and means that the abbreviations are also sourced whenever I load vim anywhere else, which I don't really want. I suppose I could source manually them every time I open vim in that directory, but that would be even worse!

So, I want a way of telling vim 'if I open a file in a git repo, check to see if there is a file `.ignore/abbreviations` and if there is then source it.

A while ago I wrote a [simple plugin](https://github.com/gpanders/vim-oldfiles) to improve Vim's native `:oldfiles` command.

`:oldfiles` has a few problems. Firstly, it doesn't have great UX: to actually edit a file from the oldfiles list you use `:e #&lt;N` where `N` is the number in the list. You can use `:browse oldfiles` to get a slightly better interface (you're prompted for a number at the bottom of the page) but it still uses the ""more"" prompt which is not very graceful.

Secondly, the underlying `v:oldfiles` variable is not updated as you use Vim, but is only read on startup and when manually invoking `:rviminfo`.

**vim-oldfiles** is a very lightweight plugin that attempts to solve both of these problems. It provides a new command `:Oldfiles` which will populate your quickfix list with your file history. You can also specify an optional search pattern with `:Oldfiles /pattern/` which will only show results matching your pattern.

I now use the oldfiles feature much more frequently, particularly when I open a new Vim ""session"" and want to re-open a file I was working on earlier.

It might seem to take away from just focusing on programming, but I think that Vim skills are an important developer skill-- learning earlier definitely seems optimal.

Anyone who went along this path, how was your experience? Would it be ""recommended""?",Should I learn Vim while also learning to program?,0

We all heared or even used the affirmation: Vim is not an IDE. How true is this affirmation? Vim is a text editing tool and code is text. A main feature of an IDE is helping you edit code.

Where is then the frontier between IDE and no IDE?

I'm hoping this is pretty simple, but I've been scouring the vifm docs and can't figure this out: how do I expand and collapse individual sub-trees in a view? I found zf, but that makes the sub-tree disappear permanently. I naively assumed that I could just do vi-style folding, but it doesn't seem to work that way. tree-view seems to be all or nothing, which is a drag.

Extra-credit: can it respect .gitignore if there is one?

Ideally, I'm trying to get this to work like the project views in IntelliJ and Visual Studio, where I can expand or collapse sub-trees as needed and have them stay that way the next time I'm in that project. The fact that there's so little discussion of this in the docs leads me to believe that isn't how this tool is meant to be used, in which case, is there a console-based file manager that plays nicely with vim that would be a better choice for this? I've played around with ranger and nnn and they didn't seem any more suited to working this way than vifm, but obviously I may have missed something.

I've been struggling quite some time now trying to find how to use regexp for vimscript. I've looked at the documentation but I think two things are inconsistent and I'd like to know why.

Let's say I have asterisks all over the place (I'll represent spaces as . and tabs as -)

`*...........*-*-*.some text`

`............*..-*.........*.some text`

`--*........*.some text`

If I do a search:

`:g/[ \t]*[*\( |\t\)\+]\+/p`

It correctly finds everything before ""some text"". This is what I want to achieve. The ""n"" key recognizes every complete match as a single match (3 in total)

However trying to do the same in vimscript through match/matchstr/matchstrpos etc, I get different restuls, or matches not found.

If I do

`:echo match(getline("".""), ""[\s]*[*\(\s\)\+]\+"")`

on top of any line, I always get -1 (not found).

So my question here is: are match patterns different from regular regex? To me it looks inconsistent, but I'd like to know your opinion and if to see if you could point me in the right direction. I suspect the fact of having to use quotes for regex in match pattern makes it different. I've also read about ""magic"" but adding \\m, \\M makes no difference.

I've also tried building the same expression as match pattern, but I have not been able to achieve the same result, I've had difficulties specially when trying to include groups \\(\\) in match patterns.",vimscript regex differences,0

Fairly new to vim (Gvim).  Trying to set up a linter for JavaScript (react, jsx).  ALE plugin installed no problem.  ESlint installed locally in project folder.  Only modification to .eslintrc was:

      ""react/jsx-filename-extension"": [1, { ""extensions"": ["".js"", "".jsx""] }],

under 'rules'.  That was to allow '.jsx' code in '.js' file.  I have set eslint to use the airbnb style guide during the 'eslint init'.

Problem

Every line of code (about 98% of it) has an error (error tag in the gutter).  Also, all the code is now red.

I use neomutt, with the editor set as vim. Until now I had been working perfectly. I decided I wanted to modify vim's behavior when opened in neomutt (things like sourcing email-specifi abbreviations like my email address, and starting in insert mode). Since the editor in neomutt is just set as a command, I put in my neomuttrc `set editor = 'vim -c source ~/.config/neomutt/config/vim/vimConfig` (the deep dir structure is useful for organisation. I have lots of config files). 

vinCofig looks like this:

    source ~/.config/neomutt/config/vim/abbreviations
    NERDTreeClose
    norm O
    norm O
    startinsert

The abbreviations file is a list of abbreviations which are only really useful for emails (specific signatures etc.). NERDTreeClose is there because vim starts with NERDTree open if the buffer is empty, but I don't want that if I'm writing a fresh email (which would have an empty buffer). The two `norm O`'s are because the vast majority of email I write is in response to other emails. this puts two lines of blank space between the quoted text and my cursor. Start in insert mode because in an email normally I just want to start writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I write an an email in neomutt, vim lanuches and prints this message:

    ""~/.config/neomutt/config/vim/vimConfig"" 5L, 90C
    Error detected while processing command line:
    E471: Argument required
    Press ENTER or type command to continue

&amp;#x200B;

If I press enter am then presented with vim with \~/.config/neomutt/config/vim/vimConfig open in the buffer. I can edit it but don't seem to be able to save the edits (if I edit it and save, then open the same file from the terminal (not neomutt) the edits haven't happened). Once I close this buffer vim exits, so I never get a chance to edit my email. 

What's going on? What am I doing wrong? The problem disappears if I just use 'vim' as my editor in neomutt (without the extra start script).

A feature I miss in Vim from VSCode are temporary buffers.  
In VSCode, when you open a buffer, it opens in a ""preview mode"" by default, which means that when you open a new file the old buffer is closed, unless it was ""pinned"" (e.g., by double clicking the tab).

This is useful to navigate the source code without ending up with tens of unwanted opened tabs.

**Problem**: I use Vim to view log files as they are written. In order to reload the file and see if more output has been written, I use `:e`. However, more than once I have pressed `:w` by mistake, and by writing to the log file while other program was outputting I have messed up the log file.

**Pseudo-solution that I found**: to open them in read-only (`nowrite`) mode by calling Vim with  `view` instead of `vim`, or to open them with with read-only (`nowrite`) and no-modify (`nomodifiable`) modes with `vim -M &lt;filename&gt;`. But it is annoying to have to remember to use these other commands instead of the usual `vim` that I'm so used to.

**Solution that I would like**: to write something in my `.vimrc` that makes Vim start automatically in `nowrite` and `nomodifiable` modes if the filename ends with `.log`. Then, if I really needed to write to a log file (which very rarely occurs, if ever), I could always set `:set write` and `:set modifiable`.

Specifically, and most annoyingly, the Fugitive plugin is very different in how it outputs text. On the Linuz box, it outputs directly in VIM under my statusbar (where ':' commands go - is there an official name for this part of the window?). However, on the Mac, it takes me out of VIM and back to my original terminal, and then when I press enter it takes me back to VIM. I cannot figure how to turn this off so that it acts like the Linux version.

This only happens when I use "":Git &lt;command&gt;"", as using the shorter "":G&lt;command&gt;"" leads to a new split opening, which appears to be the expected behavior.

Finally, I had an interesting experience where on my iMac, whenever I typed a punctuation character that comes in pairs (', [, {, etc...), VIM would automatically add the compliment without any plugins installed (I'm using Python with Python syntax turned on). However, on Linux, as well as a Macbook running OSX 10.9, I have to use the auto-pairs plugin to emulate this behavior, despite using the same vimrc.

If I have the scrolling set up with a high enough velocity, the cursor will instead move 20 lines downwards, i.e. not where I want it to go. I understand I can just do `10j`, but hear me out.  


I want to be able do do something like:  


let g:scroll\_stop\_key = ""&lt;Esc&gt;""  


exe 'nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; ' . g:scroll\_stop\_key . ' g:is\_scrolling ? call stop\_scrolling() : ' . g:scroll\_stop\_key  


with the intention that if I am *currently* scrolling, the key will stop the scrolling. If I am not scrolling, the key functions as normal.  


The above method of doing this does not seem to work, and I feel that it will have problems if the user has defined other mappings for the key they are passing as the ""stop key"".  


1. Why does the above method not work? 
2. Is there a better way to do this? If so, what is it?
3. How can I handle mapping for different modes? If I am scrolling in visual mode the above example will not work. Is there a generic 'map to all modes'?",Conditionally Map Value of Variable To Call Function Or Act As Normal,0

I have a few scripts in my `.vim/ftplugin/mail/`. One of them includes:

    "" add all the contact information in my abook
    set dictionary +=~/.contacts/personal
    set dictionary +=~/.contacts/uni
    set dictionary +=~/.contacts/charity

I use abook for contacts management, keeping all of my contacts in relevantly-names directories in \~`/.contacts` Charity is a charity I volunteer for. This snippet (conditional on the file being mail) adds to my dictionary all the different directories, so that I can have completion for names, email addresses etc. Mostly this is useful for typing names quickly and putting people in touch with other (sending them each other's information), which I have to do a lot in my role for the charity. 

This works but i would like to improve on the following:

It isn't very elegant and doesn't follow the 'vim way'. If I added a new contacts list (say `~/.contacts/extended_family`) I would have to remember to add it manually to this list in the file. I have tried `set dictionary +=~/.contacts/*` but that returns an error. I'm sure there's a good way to do this so I never need to worry about this sort of thing. What is it?

Is there a way of setting some kind of variable (probably in `~/.vim/vimrc`) of all my different contact information, then just calling that variable here and adding it the list? I know that still includes the problem of manually adding each new directory, but:

*  I edit my .vimrc more often and would probably think to add them more easily.
* The variable could perhaps be defined in a more general way (something like \~/.contacts/\* than things can be added like I have at the moment, thus solving the problem?

What's the 'best' way to do it? I'm sure there isn't a simple answer, but what do people think?","Is there a better way to do this? (a more elegant, more generalis(ed/able) way to add my contact informatoion to the completion dictionary only mail files?)",0

I have written my first Vimscript function today. It is used to populate `path` option with folders in current directory that aren't in wildignore.

It works but it also produces random characters in Vim blank buffer. Characters appear to be _virtual_ (they get replaced when you write text in buffer).

Here is function:

```
set wildignore+=tmp/*,log/*,vendor/*,node_modules/*,storage/*,coverage/*
autocmd VimEnter * :call SetPath()
function SetPath()
    for directory in split(system(""echo -n */""), "" "")
        if index(split(&amp;wildignore, "",""), directory . ""*"") == -1
	      \ &amp;&amp; index(split(&amp;path, "",""), directory . ""**"") == -1
            let &amp;path .= "","" . directory . ""**""
        endif

I've just discovered the benefits of setting vimdiff as my `merge.tool` in my .gitconfig file. 

Love it. but I thought I might ask more experienced users two questions.

First, the diff3 merge.conflictstyle seems to be the most common arrangement (i.e. so the top row is \[Local, Base, Remote\], and the bottom is \[Merged\]), but do you actually use the \[Base\] version? Kinda seems like it's just wasting space there. I can't imagine it's very common to want to take the ancestral version in any real merge.

Secondly, what do you do for remappings? I find it a bit tedious to type out `:diffget RE` and `:diffget LO` all the time, so if I set the remapping with `nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;dgr :diffget RE&lt;cr&gt;` from within the session, that speeds things up. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work when I have the same thing saved in my .vimrc. The bindings just do nothing; is this being overwritten somehow (maybe that's a git thing?) Any other suggestions as to how to shorten the ""get"" actions (and what your favourite/most conventional remappings are) would be very welcome.

I've done this, but it hasn't had any effect. As far as debugging goes, I've gone ahead and turned off the colorscheme by removing the setting of it in my `~/.vimrc`. When doing this, I *still* get the little green block between splits for `:ter` windows.  


OK, so now we know that it is the statusline plugin, not the colorscheme, or at least not something that the colorscheme *defines*.

My second colour in vim is yellow (I'm sure there's a technical term, but I mean the default colour for things like my status bar or mode indicators). This is different from the colour which highlights `NOTE:`s and `WARNING:`s in the help documentation.

When I'm moving around, with `j` and `k` occasionally one will 'hang' as a black character on a yellow background (just for that character space) on the space I moved *from*. This covers up anything that was there before, but only virtually. If I go back to that space and do it again I can achieve the same affect (sometimes) with the other character (so a highlighted virtual `j` becomes a highlighted virtual `k`). If I move away from it with `h` or `l` then the virtual character vanishes, revealing the original character (even if it's just whitespace).

I can occasionally reproduce this with `h` and `l`, but less often (because I use them less I think).

This doesn't tend to happen when I double (or treble, or more)-tap. I think that the problem has something to do with an ambiguous mapping, but what? And why only in tex documents?

If I quit a reopen the file (even if I save the changes) the phantom characters are no longer there. 

If I open NERDTree the phantom characters reamin in the same place on the screen, regardless of which window they are now in 9so they print over the NERDTree window).

I have recently installed vimtex and ultisnips. I've played around with the vimtex settings but haven't used ultisnips at all. As far as I'm aware, I haven't mapped either `j` or `k` to anything since downloading them.

What is going on?!?! How can I stop it? It's really distracting!!!

Thanks!","when editting .tex documents, I sometimes get hanging highlighted 'j' and 'k' characters when moving around. What is going on and how can I stop it?",0

Yesterday I searched a little about it and [this StackOverflow question](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/365/is-it-possible-to-use-two-different-color-backgrounds-in-a-single-vim-buffer) helped me.

The answer provided by the user Rich uses the signs features (mostly used by plugins for linting) to highlight the whole line where a sign is placed.

So I did a function that clears all signs and then starts placing signs. It first places a sign when it finds a line like ""```sh"" and continues to place it until it finds ""```"". I also disable the signcolumn because I only want the different background highlight.

Column 4 is technically the last column, so maaaybe going to the last word on the line would be a workaround. (This doesn't seem very sustainable, though, and doesn't really address the problem of going to any numbered tab).

It seems like you would want to set \t as the delimiter and go to the Nth record, but I'm a bit lost as to whether you can pass this information at runtime.",Open with cursor on specific (tabbed) column,0

I'm trying to wrap my head around how Vim deals with line endings in different file formats. Say you have a file with DOS line endings, file.txt:

If I open this one in Vim,

    vim -u NORC -b file.txt

I'm given the following:

&gt;line1\^M  
&gt;  
&gt;line2

So far so good. I'm expecting \^M which is how Vim displays the DOS carriage return. **But how do I edit this file - without changing the file format - and having the correct set of new line characters?**

If I do `vim -u NORC -c 'set ff=dos' -b file.txt` and add some newlines, they do not show up with a \^M carriage return when I save and reopen the file. Is this to be expected? Am I missing some Vim configuration?","Help me understand Vim, fileformats and line ending",0

I'd like to share with you an unusual navigation mapping I came up with.

I am not good in navigating using `ctrl-d` / `ctr-u` or the the `Page Up` /`Page Down` keys. I tried, but I always go back to scrolling with my mouse (I know...) or holding `j` and `k`.

So, last day I came up with this mapping:

`"" Hitting space makes j and k move faster`

`nmap &lt;Space&gt;j 10j&lt;Space&gt;`

`nmap &lt;Space&gt;k 10k&lt;Space&gt;`

`nmap &lt;Space&gt;&lt;Space&gt; &lt;Nop&gt;`

Basically, when `Space` is pressed (in normal mode), a sort of ""fast navigation"" mode is triggered, where `j` and `k` move 10 lines instead of just one. Another press of `Space` exits the mode.

New redditor and rather new Vim enthusiast here. In the last weeks, I've started digging into Vimscript after I realized that some features I wanted are not covered by existing plugins. I worked through 'Learn Vimscript the hard way' and already managed to get some cool things working, but I keep banging my head against this issue and can't solve it on my own. I think that plugins such as surround and sandwich have solved this issue, but I've looked into their code and didn't get it :(

I want to create a custom operator that takes a \[count\] and a {motion}. The operator works on the text selected by the {motion}, and the operation depends on the value of \[count\]. Therefore, the \[count\] and the {motion} must not be conflated! After some try and error and reading a lot of stackoverflow I've come up with the following solution, reduced to a minimal working example:

    nnoremap &lt;Plug&gt;op :&lt;C-u&gt;call Setup()&lt;CR&gt;g@ 
    nmap M &lt;Plug&gt;op
    function! Setup()
        let s:count = v:count1
        set operatorfunc=MyOperator
    endfunction
    
    function! MyOperator(type)
        if a:type ==# ""char"" || a:type ==# ""line""
            normal! `[v`]""ay
            echom ""Count="" . s:count . "", Yanked selection: "" . getreg('a')
        elseif a:type ==# ""v"" || a:type ==# ""V"" || a:type ==# ""\&lt;C-v&gt;""
            normal! gv""ay
            echom ""Count="" . s:count . "", Visual selection: "" . getreg('a')
        endif
    endfunction

The `echom` commands make it easy to see that this works as intended. The problem occurs when I try to repeat this! Without a count, `.` does the right thing. But for `[count].`, Vim only repeats the `g@` and uses the count to modify the last motion instead. As a result, both the `{motion}` and the `[count]` are wrong.

Since Vim does not offer the plugin developer the option to change what `.` does, it seems to me that the only hope is vim-repeat. So I added the following line at the end of `MyOperator`:

    call repeat#set(""&lt;Plug&gt;op"") 

Now the count is correct, but for each invocation of `.` I need to enter the motion again (unsurprisingly). Therefore, to make this work I somehow need to save the motion. But by using Vim's `g@` mechanism, I only obtain the `'[ ']` marks, which is not sufficient! I could use `input()` to save the motion explicitly and then play it back via

    execute ""normal! v"" . input . '""ay' 

but that would require the user to hit enter after the motion, which would not feel very operator-y. Alternatively, I could try to use `getchar()` but then I wouldn't know when the motion/textobject is complete!

Right now, this seems like a glaring hole in Vim's plugin API to me. Am I missing something obvious?",Creating a custom operator that takes a count and is repeatable with dot,0

```markdown
Here's a [link that will hard wrap to the next
line](https://example.com/foo/bar/baz). And let's carry on a bit, just
enough to do one more line.
```

The `line](https://example.com/foo/bar/baz)` part is one long ""word"" and long words are generally a pain with hard-wrapping, which is one of the reasons one would like to conceal the URL and ignore it for wrapping purposes.

However, even when concealing is enabled, hard-wrapping the paragraph (either with `gw` or `gq`) takes into account all the characters that are there, even those that are hidden, so the result is not much of an improvement:

```
Here's a link that will hard wrap to the next
line. And let's carry on a bit, just
enough to do one more line.
```

Ideally, I would like hard-wrapping + concealing to result in something like this displayed in my Vim buffer:

```
Here's a link that will hard wrap to the next line. And let's carry on a
bit, just enough to do one more line.
```

Which would actually correspond to this content in the file:

```
Here's a [link that will hard wrap to the next line](https://example.com/foo/bar/baz). And let's carry on a
bit, just enough to do one more line.
```

Is there a hard-wrap/conceal option that I can set to get this behavior? Or maybe a `formatexpr` function that achieves this? AFAIK, the only environment that does this is Emacs org-mode and it's really pretty slick :)",Make hard-wrapping play nice with Markdown link concealing,0

Some tmux posting today got me thinking about a problem that's been causing me heartburn for the last year or so in Vim.

When I was a windows user, I tried to only open one instance of Vim to avoid the ""Hey someone already has this swap file!"" problem.  Now I run a tiling window manager on linux with good clipboard support and I find I have (generally) 2-3 vim sessions open.

I can use vim --servername vim --remote-silent foo.c or whatever to guarantee that every file opens in the SAME instance of Vim... but it's not quite what I want.

# Question
Without using a shared tmux session or pinning my opened Vim instance to every ""tag""/""screen"" of my tiling window manager, is there a way to synchronize open buffers across multiple instances in classic Vim?

It seems to me that client-server Vim should be able to do this, but all the searching I've done points to ""you want to use splits"" or ""use the remote flag to launch in the same window"" but that's not quite right.

What I actually want is separately open vim instances that contain all the buffers in all the instances.

That way if I'm on screen 1 writing some code and I open my .vimrc with my current code project, if I flip to screen 2 and try to open .vimrc, it doesn't say ""Hey the swap file is busy you dummy"" it just gives me access to the same buffers again but through a different viewport.

Is this stupid?  Should I just disable swap files and save like crazy?

The creator published about his new app a few months ago on Reddit ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/dc95by/vimac_vimium_for_macos/)) and everyone was discussing monetization and no one cared to share it enough.

If a tool is going to affect your daily interaction with the system you use daily, it should be more popular.

I can ramble forever, but you need to know that I'm typically aware of the new apps and tools to a certain extent and the fact that this didn't show up on my radar earlier says something.

I have seen a number of 10x developers using such tools to increase their productivity even more. You need to see how my manager uses Vimium and you will understand (if you blink you miss 10 steps) and I can feel his pain when he has to switch to a mouse for system navigation.

 Tools that come to mind that has a similar effect (for developers at least):

 \- [vim-anywhere](https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere)

\- [PopClip Extensions](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) (with a script to invoke it from the keyboard)

\-  Enhanced accessibility features Mojave like \`show grid\` (activated via voice and system-wide hotkey)","Life changer app, why isn't vimacapp more popular",0

`linebreak` should make it so that it doesn't insert linebreaks (i.e. hit 'ENTER'). Well when I get to column 85 in my files, it throws in a break anyway. I can go back to the beginning of the new line and escape it out, but that gets annoying quick when you are doing something like writing an email in vim :)

My main issue now is figuring out the ecosystem a little bit. I'm having some trouble deciding how best to start using Vim as a main editor.

These are the options:

\- gVim in Windows (I'm finding it annoying with some of the batch files not working properly and not being able to make the window color dark, like the title bar etc.). Also, one of the biggest advantages I've heard is the terminal + vim combination, which is annoying to set up with cmd/powershell (if anyone has good recommendations, please do tell. I've heard Cmder is useful, but I've not tried it)

\- Using WSL also seems very popular, but I'm not sure exactly how this works. Just using multiple WSL terminal windows? I don't really understand this set up, but I've not used WSL much so maybe thats why.

\- The last option is to use an Ubuntu VM and launch Vim in that. That way I have access to all the native Linux tools and there's no need for hacking around. And I can just mount my windows drives and have access to any data I need. I'm comfortable with VMs as all my development used to be done on a VM, with Windows as my main for Windows only software and games. I use Windows now as my main dev environment though, so I'd like Vim to be set up and usable straight away in case I ever need it.

Recently I got to use PHPStorm on a web project and I really like the auto completion in PHPStorm.  


If you write the following inside of an HTML file:  


&lt;div class=""""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  


...put your cursor inside of the double quotes """", and hit Ctrl+Space,

you get a list of all classes that can be found in every css file in your workspace. So even if the file is inside a folder structure, as long as its in the workspace every single class will be listed.  


Having that autocompletion is really great. We also use Bootstrap, so if you type something in like  
""mxs0"" you get the proper ""mx-sm-0"" as a suggestion. Really, really handy.  


I would like to ask you, how one should approach to recreate this awesome autocompletion inside of vim/nvim  


I'm not really good at configuring vim, but i tried coc.vim. Sadly i could not get it to autocomplete CSS classes inside of HTML templates.  


Do you guys have any suggestions or guides that i could check out.  


Otherwise it will probably take me many months to figure this stuff out.

I created a vim plugin for opening with vim as well as navigating in the contents of debian packages.

It works pretty much the same as opening zipfiles / tarballs with vim, simply point vim to the debian package and it will open its list of files in vim for you to explore.

Navigating in the debian package is handed over to `netrw`. In there you can also modify existing files of the package, add additional files or edit the CONTROL information of the package. On exit, if the plugin detects that there were changes, it repackages the debian package again and by default puts it under `&lt;orig-deb-package-name.deb&gt;.new`.

Here's a link to the plugin: [https://github.com/bergercookie/vim-deb-preview](https://github.com/bergercookie/vim-deb-preview).

I loved Emacs and I delved every day deeper into it, mastering it in many ways.

Some months ago I needed to do stuff on a server that was not mine and the owner didn't want that I installed anything on it. So I had to choose between Nano and Vim and I obviously choosed Vim .

I started using it beside Emacs and last week, after some months I decided to totally switch to it (actually in these days I'm trying Neovim). 

Why did I switch?

1) I'm a firm believer in KISS, I use ArchLinux, and some Suckless stuff as Dwm. And I must say Vi(m) is KISSer as Emacs.

2) I often work on VPSs and remote Linux servers and I don't want to install Emacs on every server I work on.

3) Sometime I have to work on very big files, on which I see that Vi(m) is very faster.

4) Vi(m) shortcuts are faster and you don't destroy your little finger hitting CTRL one billion of times per minute.

That's it. I just wanted to share this. I don't hate Emacs and (as said before) I don't take part in the Vi(m) VS Emacs war but, for what I need and what I have to do, Vi(m) is just soooo better.",Why I switched from Emacs to Vi(m),0

I have been using Ale for a while, but I was hearing 'CoC' quite a lot lately here, so I figure I should try it out. I'm using Python and Go daily. 

First of all, I'm not really sure I understand what CoC-Nvim do (the project itself).  If want to use Python for example, I need to install the extension. It looks like other extensions support other languages. So what does the core CoC-Nvim is for?

So I download the Python extensions. The main page mention a bug with the Microsoft Python Language server and memory (and performance for me and to keep nvim snappy Is something I really try to to keep in mind), so I enable local linter instead (Pylint). The first thing I notice, is that it takes 1-2 seconds for linting to show problem after I save the buffer or leave Insert. In Ale, it was instant. I might be wrong, but It looks like CoC not running linting async?

So while linting was slow, CoC solved other issues for me. For example, It's wrapper Jedi and Ctags nicely, so I didn't have to manage couple of plug-ins for auto-complete and tags. I noticed you can skip Diagnostics with CoC (linting) and instead do it with Ale using: \`diagnostic.displayByAle"": true\`. I'm not sure what it does. Ale will still display linting because, the plug-in is installed, and when I check Diagnostics with CoC - I see no Diagnostics - so that feels just like disabling Diagnostics on Coc and running Ale-lint in the background. It doesn't seems like they share information or anything.

So I'm kinda in a strange mix where I use CoC-python for Auto-complete and Ctags, but Linting is done with Ale, and than I noticed Ale can integrate deoplete for auto-complete, and I was thinking maybe I should just revert back to Ale to avoid both ale and CoC plugin in memory ... and yeah. Confused.

Maybe someone can clear it up for me? To be honest, the only reason I was checking CoC - was because I was wondering how it performs again ale (as I mentioned, want to keep things snappy). I couldn't find benchmarks and such, so if anyone did play with it - I would also like to hear about it.
